Suggests: libexcept-doc
Description: Base exception handling for Snap! C++.
 The libexcept library is used to enhance the basic C++ exceptions by adding
 support for an automatic stack dump. This is particularly useful to find
 where the exception occurred in a large C++ project without having to search
 for hours.
