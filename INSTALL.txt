# Compile, Build, Install

This project is part of the `snapcpp` environment.

It depends on the `snapwebsites-cmake-modules` project.

Within the `snapcpp` project, it gets build automatically when you build the
entire environment:

    snapcpp/bin/build-snap --processors 8

Without the `snapcpp` full environement, make sure that the
`snapwebsites-cmake-modules` is installed first. You can download a
packaged version (.deb) from the
[snapcpp project PPA](https://launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)
on Launchpad.

This project uses cmake to generate the Makefile necessary to build the
project:

   git clone git@github.com:m2osw/libexcept.git
   mkdir BUILD
   cd BUILD
   cmake ../libexcept
   make
   [sudo] make install

This should work on all Unices. At this point, though, we have been working
on Ubuntu 16.04.

We have not yet worked on the project to get it to function under MS-Windows.
